### Hi there 👋

I’m Aakash, a Computer Engineering student at the National University of Singapore. I’m passionate about software development, machine learning, and embedded systems. I love to learn new technologies and build cool projects.

Some of the projects that I have worked on are:

TroopTrak: A cross-platform mobile app that helps commanders in the SAF to track and manage their troops’ administrative tasks. Built with Dart and Flutter, and integrated with Cloud Firestore. Achieved the highest level of achievement (Artemis) in NUS Orbital 2023. 🏆

Day Planner: A desktop app that helps users to plan, schedule, and complete their tasks throughout the day. Built with C# and WPF, and connected to a MySQL database. 📅
You can find the source code and more details of these projects on my GitHub profile. Feel free to check them out and give me your feedback. 😊

I’m also proficient in C, C++, Python, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. I have experience working with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), bare-metal GPIO programming, and various APIs and frameworks.

I’m fluent in English and Tamil, both spoken and written. I enjoy reading books, playing games, and watching movies in my free time. 📚🎮🎥

I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations.

- 🌱 I’m currently taking an Intro to Machine Learning Course using Python, learning relevant libraries such pandas, numpy and matplotlib!
